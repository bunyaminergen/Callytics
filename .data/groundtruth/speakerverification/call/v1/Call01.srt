[CSR] Hello and welcome to Callytics! My name is Emily. How may I assist you?

00:00:09,582 --> 00:00:20,410
[Customer] Hi, Emily. I’ve been having trouble receiving notification emails.
They used to arrive instantly, but now there’s a long delay.

00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:27,879
[CSR] I’m sorry for the inconvenience. Let me take a look.
Could you give me your account details so I can verify the email settings?

4
00:00:28,552 --> 00:00:35,850
[Customer] Of course. My username is user101,
and the associated email is bunyamin@gmail.com.

00:00:38,028 --> 00:00:51,882
[CSR] Thank you. Checking now… It appears your notification preferences
were reset during a recent update. I’ll adjust them back to real-time alerts,
so you should start getting prompt emails again.

00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,053
[Customer] That’s great news. Thanks for fixing it so quickly!

Let me know if there’s anything else I can do for you today.

[Customer] Nope, that’s everything. Have a good day, Emily.

00:01:09,016 --> 00:01:11,575
