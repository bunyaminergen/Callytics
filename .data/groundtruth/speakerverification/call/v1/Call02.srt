[CSR] Hi there! You’ve reached Callytics Support, and this is Emily speaking. What can I do for you today?

00:00:10,153 --> 00:00:17,480
[Customer] Hello, Emily. I recently upgraded to your premium subscription, but I haven’t seen
any new features activated on my account.

00:00:19,213 --> 00:00:26,634
[CSR] Thanks for letting me know. Could you share your account email or username so I
can check what might be causing the issue?

00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:30,914
[Customer] Sure, my email is bunyamin@gmail.com.

00:00:32,677 --> 00:00:49,882
[CSR] Perfect. One moment while I look that up… It appears there was a slight delay with
the activation. I’ll go ahead and expedite the process. Your premium features should be live within
the next 15 minutes.
